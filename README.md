# Ruleset
These typical nuzlocke rules apply and are enforced by the mod:

* Pokémon can't be revived. Period.
* Only one encounter per route per encounter type. If the Pokémon flees or faints it's gone forever.
* Pokémon must be nicknamed.
* Items can't be used in battle.
* If the encounter is a shiny, it can be caught no matter if it's a duplicate.

# Misc

* Pokémon won't show up if you already own the species, fused or unfused. Fainted Pokémon aren't counted.
* Since grinding wild Pokémon is not an option, Pokémon can be leveled up in the party menu.
* Available encounters can be viewed in pause menu.

# How to use

# Compatibility

I tested this mod with version 6.2.4 and 6.4.3 of Pokémon Infinite Fusion. All versions in between should be compatible as well.
